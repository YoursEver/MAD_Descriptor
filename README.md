## ü§ù Academic-Industrial Collaboration

This work is the outcome of an academic-industrial collaboration with [iGroup-Taiwan](https://www.igroup.com.tw/).

The MAD descriptor was implemented by **Mr. Tse-Yu Tseng**, my former master‚Äôs student, who has been with iGroup-Taiwan since **October 2023**.

The source code has been integrated into the scientific image integrity software, [**ImaChek**](https://www.imachek.com/).

If you're interested in testing the MAD descriptor or requesting a free trial of ImaChek, please contact:  
üìß **service@imachek.com**
<br>(Please mention in your email that you found this information on Prof. Shao's GitHub page.)

Thank you for your interest and support!
